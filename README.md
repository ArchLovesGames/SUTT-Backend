SUTT Backend Task 1: Mess Menu Parsing

Task Description:

I was tasked to create a python program that obtains data from the mess menu sheet (added in repository), parses the data accordingly by creating an object, serealising it, and appending it to a JSON file. Additionally, was tasked to address the inconsistencies in the data, such as empty/missing values, or nonsensical characters ("*********") being placed into the sheet. For this task, I used Python and Openpyxl.

# Contents

1. parse.py: The python script coded to parse the excel sheet
2. Mess menu.xlsx: The reference mess menu used for the data parsing
3. messmenu.json: The parsed json file recieved after parsing the excel sheet using parse.py
